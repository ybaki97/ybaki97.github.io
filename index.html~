    Welcome to my website! I am a sixth year PhD candidate and currently on the job market. My research interests are in noncommutative ring theory,
    and I am gratefully advised by <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~mreyes/" target="_blank"> Manuel Reyes </a>. My current work focuses on group-gradings
    of Calabiâ€“Yau algebras.
