        Welcome to my website! I am a sixth year PhD candidate in the mathematics department at the University of California, Irvine. I am currently on the job market. My research interests are in noncommutative ring theory, and I am advised by <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~mreyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manuel Reyes</a>. My current work focuses on group-gradings of Calabiâ€“Yau algebras.
