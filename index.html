    Welcome to my website! I am a sixth year PhD candidate and currently on the job market. My research interests are in noncommutative ring theory, and I am gratefully advised by <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~mreyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manuel Reyes</a>. My current work focuses on group-gradings of Calabiâ€“Yau algebras. A current copy of my CV can be found here.
