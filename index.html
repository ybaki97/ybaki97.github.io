        <p>
        Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at 
	<a href="https://math.asu.edu/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	Arizona 
	State University</a>. I received my PhD from the University of California, 
	Irvine in 2025, where I was advised by 
	<a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~mreyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manuel Reyes</a>.
	My research interests are in noncommutative ring theory, and current work focuses on non-abelian group-gradings of Calabiâ€“Yau algebras.
